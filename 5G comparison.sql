--this dataset contains information of user metrics, revenue, in different cities of a telecom company. 

/* AtliQo is one of the leading telecom providers in India and launched its 5G plans in May 2022 along with other telecom providers.

The management noticed a decline in their active users and revenue growth post 5G launch in May 2022. 
AtliQoâ€™s business director requested their analytics team to provide a comparison report
of KPIs between pre and post-periods of the 5G launch.

The management is keen to compare the performance between these periods 
and get insights that would enable them to make informed decisions 
to recover their active user rate and other key metrics. 

I am assigned to this task as a junior data analyst.

Skills used for this project - SQL basics, JOIN functions, AGGREGATE functions, 
Database modifications, case when functions, UNION functions.
